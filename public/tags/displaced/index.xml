      <description>&lt;p&gt;The novel takes on the nature of a harmonious collage reflected in the world as I know it. I was the reader to approximate the white hot intensity I felt as I wrote these pages and to live through the experience of being continually displaced, not because I am playing intellectual games but because the lives of these characters demand it. Dates and geographic location are often omitted as time is not of essence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are obsessed with information and pragmatism at the expense of beauty and truth. With the writing of this fiction cyclorama based on biographical events, I am taking full advantage of my feminie psychological make-up, my unique network of neurons. Every man tells me my head works differently from his, that a woman is unable to think in terms of cause and effect, that he will never fathom how a woman&amp;rsquo;s head works. I consider that a great asset for an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
