My play, THE LION AND THE LIONESS, a tragicomedy, is based on the diaries of Lev and Sonia Tolstoy kept for 48 years of their tempestuous marriage. The strucutre is cyclical, using the technique of reverse chronology to explore the couple's relationship, starting with Tolstoy's death in 1910 and ending on the night before the couple's wedding in 1862. The appearance of two hooligan characters provides a sly, running commentary on the drama of the two titanic figures at the center.

THE LION AND THE LIONESS continues to be immensely popular because, as Valentyna Hrytsuk wrote in "Slaivc and East European Performance" magaize, "the audience is first drawn to the theme of contemporary marriage, the eternal conflict between a man and woman..."
