The novel takes on the nature of a harmonious collage reflected in the world as I know it. I was the reader to approximate the white hot intensity I felt as I wrote these pages and to live through the experience of being continually displaced, not because I am playing intellectual games but because the lives of these characters demand it. Dates and geographic location are often omitted as time is not of essence.

We are obsessed with information and pragmatism at the expense of beauty and truth. With the writing of this fiction cyclorama based on biographical events, I am taking full advantage of my feminie psychological make-up, my unique network of neurons. Every man tells me my head works differently from his, that a woman is unable to think in terms of cause and effect, that he will never fathom how a woman's head works. I consider that a great asset for an artist.
