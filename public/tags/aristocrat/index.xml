      <description>&lt;p&gt;This story goes back to the Paleolithic epoch when a woman threw her man out of the cave to hunt in distant woods as the nearby ones had become depleted. In the play a Ukrainian actor goes to England to earn money and becomes the caretaker of an elderly couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action is develop through a linear chain of events. Fiona proposes that boris play the role of her daughter Clarissa (who either never existed or has ceased to exist) which provokes his spontaneous, anarchic behavior. The seed has fallen on fertile soil since Boris is an actor by profession. At first he acts out the couple&amp;rsquo;s fantasies then, taking on the role of director, assigns them roles. He prepares Fiona, for her gentleman caller and makes Phineas over into the colorful Cossack leader Ivan Mazepa, a role he himself was to have played in Kiev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his new life, Boris beings to enjoy going from one role to another until he receives news of his wife&amp;rsquo;s betrayal. Meanwhile, in the mistaken notion that the actor has taken advantage of his wife&amp;rsquo;s descent into madness, the old man takes his revenge and proposes that Boris play the role of dog. When Boris&amp;rsquo; wife confirms her affair with a neighbor, the actor, depressed and drained of all energy, agrees. In his sedentary role, he evaluates his past and vows never to be victimized again. Boris the dog-philosopher changes into a totalitarian dog, and exhibits features of his Stalinist past. He terrorizes the old couple into working in his service as he takes on his last role of aristocrat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop his anarchic energy which has overturned his stable world, the old man kills Boris. But the old man is unable to arrest the creative drive that has flowered in the old woman. She makes Boris&amp;rsquo; body into a work of art, marinating him in the costume of the Cossack Mazepa. Boris&amp;rsquo; wife, now a successful businesswoman, buys the artwork and carries on monologues in front of her eternally enticing husband as he bathes in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Anglo-Saxon conservatism and Ukrainian political correctness, with obligatory portraits of its national heroes, are ironically treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accent in this play is on theatricality. Reality is present through both the aesthetics of the grotesque and the absurd. The emotional and psychological metamorphosis is rendered through the prism of a play within a play.&lt;/p&gt;
