DISPLACED
An American and Ukrainian are drawn to one another the first time they meet in Moscow in 1969. Orest and Irena are brother and sister in their twenties, about to spend August travelling through Soviet Ukraine with a tourist group, a trip that will change their lives forever. 

A beautiful, naïve and shy Irena is hungry for adventure. Having lived a sheltered, academic existence up to now, she begins to forge her own ideas about the Soviet world around her. In her brother’s eyes, she wakes up to her own womanhood. Orest grows to love Irena as a sister but secretly wants her as a woman. When two KGB agents attempt to engage Irena in espionage, Orest is the pawn and Irena must make an agonizing choice. 

The month is framed by multiple flashbacks beginning with a wrenching decision to leave the infant Orest with his grandparents as the parents escape from Soviet Ukraine during WWII. Scenes reveal the horrors wrought by war and the Soviet occupation, their grandparents’ exile to Siberia, the turmoil of immigrant life in the Germany and the United States, the tortured relationship between their parents, Josef and Marusia, and the contrasting milieus in which Irena and Orest grow up. 
Humorous, satiric episodes offer a respite to the overwhelming, profound tragedy of a family’s disintegration.

DISPLACED, an autobiographical novel, a story of abandonment, loss, upheaval and reconciliation. It creates a magical world in which everything is dislocated: time, identity, love, country and allegiance.
